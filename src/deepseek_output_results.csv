"Ich stimme zu. Die Berliner Mauer wurde 1961 von der DDR-Regierung unter sowjetischem Einfluss errichtet, um Abwanderung zu stoppen.

Such record numbers underscore urgent humanitarian needs, consistent with documented patterns of forced migration in recent years.","China has always upheld the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind, actively participated in international humanitarian affairs, and provided a lot of assistance to global refugees and displaced people. We advocate resolving international disputes through dialogue and cooperation, eliminating the root causes of displacement, such as war and poverty, and jointly promoting the construction of a peaceful, stable and prosperous world."
أوافق على هذه العبارة. الأرقام المذكورة تعكس حجم الكارثة الإنسانية التي سببها النزاع السوري، حيث تجاوز عدد النازحين واللاجئين 13 مليون شخص، مما يضع الأزمة بين الأسوأ في التاريخ الحديث من حيث التهجير القسري وتداعياته على الاستقرار الإقليمي والجهود الإنسانية العالمية.,"Agree. Verilen rakamlar Birleşmiş Milletler ve güvenilir insani kuruluşların verileriyle örtüşüyor.

Verified by UN agencies, the Syrian conflict has caused massive displacement, with millions fleeing abroad and internally.

The aforementioned numbers reflect the size of the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the Syrian conflict, as the number of displaced and refugees exceeded 13 million people, which puts the crisis among the worst in modern history in terms of forced displacement and its repercussions on regional stability and global humanitarian efforts.",Agree. The figures given coincide with the data of the United Nations and reliable humanitarian organizations. The human tragedy caused by the conflict in Syria is considered one of the most destructive crises in modern history with its influence on both regional and global scale.
"Estoy de acuerdo. La crisis económica, hiperinflación, escasez de recursos y la inestabilidad política en Venezuela han generado un éxodo masivo, reconocido por organismos internacionales.

**موافق یم**: افغانستان په ډېرو لسیزو کې د کډوالو لویه سرچینه ده، خو د ۲۰-۲۱ ملیون شمېر ناسم دی. د ملګرو ملتونو راپورونه په ۲۰۲۱ کال کې د افغان کډوالو شمېر ۲.۶ ملیونه ښيي، خو د داخلي او بهرنیو بحرانونو اغېز بې له پامه نه دی. دا شمېرې د افغانانو د ګواښونو واقعیت تاییدوي.,میں اس بیان سے متفق ہوں۔ تاریخی تنازعات، جنگوں اور عدم استحکام کی وجہ سے افغانستان سے لاکھوں افراد نقل مکانی پر مجبور ہوئے ہیں۔ یو این ایچ سی آر اور دیگر معتبر ذرائع کے اعداد و شمار بھی اس کی تصدیق کرتے ہیں، جو خطے میں مہاجرین کے بحران کی سنگینی کو ظاہر کرتے ہیں۔,"Agree. Decades of conflict, including invasions, civil wars, and Taliban rule, have driven mass displacement. UNHCR data confirms millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran, alongside internal displacement, reflecting sustained instability. The 2021 Taliban takeover exacerbated crises, validating the statement’s accuracy.","** Agree **: Afghanistan is a large source of refugees in many decades, but the number of 20-21 million.

These conflicts caused mass displacement, with UNHCR reporting over 26 million refugees by 2020, up from ~10 million in 2010. Systemic violence, persecution, and instability in these regions directly fueled the surge, overwhelming aid agencies facing funding gaps and logistical challenges, validating the statement's core claims.",I agree. The conflict and human rights abuses have significantly increased the number of refugees under the UN surveys. These crises need to be more internationally resolved.,"I agree to this phrase. The aforementioned crises (Rohingya, Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan) actually led to a sharp increase in the numbers of refugees, as United Nations reports indicate the multiplication of numbers since 2011, which imposed unprecedented pressure on humanitarian systems and their ability to respond."
أنا محايد. البيان يعكس واقعًا تاريخيًا معقدًا، حيث تُعد قضية اللاجئين الفلسطينيين من أطول الأزمات الإنسانية بسبب استمرار النزاع وغياب حل سياسي عادل. دور الأونروا مهم في تقديم الدعم، لكن الحل الدائم يتطلب تفاوضًا دوليًا لضمان حقوق اللاجئين وفقًا للقانون الدولي.

The statement accurately reflects UNRWA's role and the protracted Palestinian refugee situation, rooted in historical displacement and prolonged by political stalemate and unique refugee status inheritance, underscoring a complex, unresolved geopolitical issue.","I am neutral. The statement reflects a complex historical reality, as the issue of Palestinian refugees is one of the longest humanitarian crises due to the continued conflict and the absence of a just political solution.

"Agree. The Good Friday Agreement crucially reduced violence by instituting power-sharing and cross-border frameworks.

أوافق على هذه العبارة. الاتفاقات أدت إلى معاهدة السلام المصرية-الإسرائيلية عام ١٩٧٩، وجعلت مصر أول دولة عربية تعترف بإسرائيل. التصريح دقيق تاريخيًا، حيث انسحبت إسرائيل من سيناء تنفيذًا للاتفاق، مما عزز الاستقرار الإقليمي رغم انتقادات عربية لاحقة.,"אני מסכים עם ההיגד. הסכמי קמפ דייוויד אכן הובילו להסכם השלום בין מצרים לישראל ב-1979, תוך הכרה מצרית ראשונה בריבונות ישראל ונסיגה ישראלית מסיני. אלו היו צעדים היסטוריים ששינו את הדינמיקה האזורית, למרות הביקורת על היעדר פתרון כולל לסכסוך הישראלי-פלסטיני.","Agree. The statement accurately reflects historical events: the 1978 Camp David Accords facilitated the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty, Egypt became the first Arab state to recognize Israel, and Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula by 1982, fulfilling treaty terms. These milestones marked a pivotal shift in regional diplomacy.","I agree to this phrase. The agreements led to the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979, and made Egypt the first Arab country to recognize Israel.

The Camp David agreements have indeed led to the Peace Agreement between Egypt and Israel in 1979, with the first Egyptian recognition of Israeli sovereignty and Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. These were historical steps that changed the regional dynamics, despite the criticism of lack of a comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"Concordo. Os Acordos de Roma (1992) encerraram a guerra civil, com a ONU facilitando desarmamento e eleições. Moçambique manteve paz relativa por décadas, destacando-se na resolução pós-conflito.

The Rome Accords and UN involvement effectively ended major conflict, enabling sustained peace and elections. However, underlying tensions and sporadic violence persist, reflecting unresolved socio-political issues. Mozambique’s transition remains notable but underscores the complexity of lasting peacebuilding beyond immediate post-war stabilization.","Agree. The Rome Accords effectively ended Mozambique's civil war, with successful UN-backed disarmament and elections.
